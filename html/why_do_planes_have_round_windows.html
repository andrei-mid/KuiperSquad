            <h1 class="titlu">Why do planes have round windows?</h1>

            <p class="text-normal">If you’ve ever flown on a plane or observed one up close, you may have noticed that modern aircraft have round windows. But have you ever wondered why? Interestingly, early planes had square windows that seemed to work just fine. However, as aviation evolved and planes began to fly at higher altitudes and speeds, these square windows became a fatal flaw.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="text-bold">Understanding the Problem</p>
            <br>

            <p class="text-normal">
                To comprehend why round windows became the standard, we need to first understand what happens as planes ascend to higher altitudes.</p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="text-normal">The first commercial passenger jet, the British-designed de Havilland Comet, took to the skies in 1949. It was a revolutionary design, combining speed, comfort, and, notably, its "large square windows." Initially, this design was highly praised. However, after 25 hull losses, 13 fatal crashes, and 492 fatalities, investigators realized something had gone wrong. The Comet’s design flaw—its square windows—was responsible for these tragic failures.</p> <br> <br>

            <p class="text-bold">The Role of Pressure</p>
            <br>

            <p>
                <span class="text-normal">Let’s explore the physics behind this. According to the </span><span class="text-bold">International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) </span><span class="text-normal">the air pressure at sea level is </span><span class="text-bold">1013.25 hPa. </span><span class="text-normal">As a plane climbs to a cruising altitude of around 36,000 feet (approximately 11,000 meters), the outside air pressure drops to about 200 hPa—nearly five times lower than at ground level. In the early days of aviation, planes flew lower, at around 15,000 feet, where the pressure differential wasn't as extreme, so cabins weren’t pressurized.</span>
            </p> <br> <br>

            <p class="text-normal">However, as planes started flying higher, pressurized cabins became necessary for passenger comfort. This introduced a new challenge: the need to maintain higher pressure inside the plane while the outside pressure was much lower. When air is confined, it naturally seeks ways to escape, creating immense strain on the aircraft’s fuselage, particularly around windows—the weak points in the structure where the pressure hull is interrupted.</p> <br> <br>

            <p class="text-bold">The Fatal Flaw of Square Windows</p> <br> <br>

            <div class="poza-articol">
                <img src="../poze_articole/stress-patrat.png">
                <img src="../poze_articole/stress-cerc.png">
            </div> <br>

            <p class="text-normal">The de Havilland Comet’s square windows were the primary cause of its structural failures. Sharp corners on square windows became stress concentration points, where tension would build up under repeated pressure changes during takeoff, cruising, and landing. Over time, this caused metal fatigue, leading to cracks and eventually catastrophic failures of the fuselage. But it could also make the windows burst.</p> <br> <br>

            <p class="text-bold">Why Round Windows Are Safer</p> <br>

            <p class="text-normal">Circular or rounded windows distribute pressure evenly across their surface, reducing the chances of stress concentration. The smooth, "cornerless" design eliminates weak points, ensuring that the fuselage can withstand the extreme pressure differences between the inside and outside of the plane. By adopting round windows, engineers could drastically reduce the risk of structural failures due to stress buildup.</p><br>

            <p class="text-bold">Lessons Learned</p><br>
            
            <p class="text-normal">In the aftermath of the Comet disasters, investigations identified the square windows as the root cause, leading to an immediate redesign with smaller, round windows. Unfortunately, by then, the damage to the Comet’s reputation was irreversible. Meanwhile, Boeing, with its 707 jets, capitalized on the lessons learned, ultimately dominating the commercial aviation market.</p> <br> <br>

            <p class="text-normal">This story is a sobering reminder of the importance of critical thinking and questioning long-held designs. Sometimes, even seemingly small details—like the shape of a window—can have massive consequences. In this case, a tragic loss of life led to safer aircraft for future generations.</p> <br> <br>

            <p class="text-bold">The Takeaway</p><br>

            <p class="text-normal">Never stop asking questions, and always remain critical of designs and systems, no matter how established they may seem. Continuous improvement, guided by curiosity and science, is often the key to preventing disasters and saving lives.</p><br>
